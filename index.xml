      <description>Most naturalistas are hair junkies.
Not necessarily because we&amp;rsquo;re hoarders, but because we&amp;rsquo;re constantly on the lookout for the next &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; hair product. Something that&amp;rsquo;s gonna save us time and give our hair that perfect bounce.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s possible to reach that point of being perfectly happy with our hair. Personally, even on good hair days I could walk into a shop, see a new product, and think &amp;ldquo;maybe this is going to revolutionise the way I do my hair&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I remember the night I met Jordan. I had just cut my hair pretty short and was attempting to rock corn rows on the side with the rest of my curls. The hair cut didn&amp;rsquo;t quite go as planned andÂ I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I was looking my prettiest.
The sweet thing is, when it&amp;rsquo;s his turn to retell the story about how we met, it goes something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;I saw this cute curly girl who I thought I&amp;rsquo;d probably never see again&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;.</description>

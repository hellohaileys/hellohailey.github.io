Most naturalistas are hair junkies.

Not necessarily because we're hoarders, but because we're constantly on the lookout for the next "best" hair product. Something that's gonna save us time and give our hair that perfect bounce.

I don't know if it's possible to reach that point of being perfectly happy with our hair. Personally, even on good hair days I could walk into a shop, see a new product, and think "maybe this is going to revolutionise the way I do my hair".

Thankfully Jordan has helped me to think, slightly, more logically. Now that I've moved to the States, I have more hair products and brands than I've ever had at my disposal in South Africa. Jordan has just given me one request: Don't buy new products until you've finished using your current stash. Fair enough. As a single gal, I had so many products that were just standing around collecting dust, and I never ended up using them.

So currently I have a simple, yet effective curly hair routine, which goes as follows:

<ul>
	<li>I start by washing it using <i>Shae Moisture </i><i><a href="https://www.sheamoisture.com/coconut-hibiscus-curl-shine-shampoo.html">Shampoo</a></i><i> and </i><i><a href="https://www.sheamoisture.com/coconut-hibiscus-curl-shine-conditioner1.html">Conditioner</a></i><i> (the Coconut and Hibiscus range</i>). Then I detangle it with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cricket-4625-Ultra-Smooth-Detangler/dp/B006O09VFA/ref=sr_1_6_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1519963734&sr=1-6&keywords=detangler%2Bcomb&th=1">detangler comb</a> in the shower.</li>
	<li>While it's still damp, I spray a little <i>Curls </i><i><a href="https://www.curls.biz/Lavish-curls-moisturizer.html">Lavish Curls Moisturizer</a></i> and comb it through in sections.</li>
	<li>Then I use <i>Shae Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus </i><i><a href="https://www.sheamoisture.com/coconut-hibiscus-curl-enhancing-smoothie.html">Curl Enhancing Smoothie</a></i>, and <i>Devines </i><i><a href="http://us.davines.com/this-is-a-curl-building-serum/d/1075">This is a Curl Building Serum</a></i> (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/styled_by_felicia">@styled_by_felicia</a> hooked a girl up with this, she also cuts my hair. I absolutely love this serum). I comb my hair with both products in it, using a <i>Goody</i> <a href="http://www.goody.com/Products/Styling_Tools/Goody_Detangle_It_Vent_Brush?colId=a9275756-ed2a-4789-a434-edcbecd55946&c_id=">detangling brush</a> (any good detangling brush should do).
	</li>
</ul>

It's currently winter, so I also use a diffuser on my hair dryer to dry my hair, which I realised also gives my curls that extra bounce and keeps me from getting sick due to walking around with wet hair. I used to do that in South Africa, sometimes even on winter days; my mom would often say in her Russian accent: "You can't go outside with wet hair!" I get it now.

So, have fun with your natural hair journey. Kinky/curly hair is an enigma. What works for one person, won't necessarily work for everyone. While pacing yourself with the amount of hair products you have on your shelves, try out different ones to see what works best for you.

I'd love to hear what you're currently using for your hair routine and how you're finding it... Leave a comment xx

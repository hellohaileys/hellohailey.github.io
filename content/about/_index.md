Hello!

We are Jordan and Diane Hailey, a newly married husband and wife who've been inspired to start this blog by our amazing opportunities, experiences and friends.

We both come from biracial backgrounds, Jordan being Caucasian and African-American, and Diane being Zulu (South African) and Russian. As a result, we love to experience different cultures, food and music.

After surviving a long distance relationship for several years, we have learnt the true value of communication and documenting our good times. We would like to share all the things we love, lessons we've learnt along the way, our eclectic style and adventures after starting our new life together.

Thank you for following along on our journey.

\- The Haileys
